# Clima Weather App

Weâ€™re going to make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by Olia Gozha. By the end of the module, you'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!

## Project Overview

The Clima Weather App is a Flutter project that provides real-time weather data for the current device location and allows users to search for weather information in any city worldwide.
